## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: Batok Coconut Hunt
- **Category**: gaming

### Description
**Batok Coconut Hunt** is a fun and fast-paced game where players test their reflexes and precision by catching falling coconuts before they hit the ground.
The challenge grows as coconuts drop faster and in greater numbers, pushing your speed and focus to the limit.
Collect as many coconuts as you can to score points, unlock achievements, and compete for the highest score. With simple controls, engaging gameplay, and a tropical vibe, **Batok Coconut Hunt** is easy to play but hard to master.

### SL Integration  
Batok Coconut Hunt will integrate **Soundness Layer** to:
1. Verify zkProofs of quest completion.
2. Enable reward distribution ( Token / NFT ) only upon valid proof verification.

## Technical

### Architecture
1. Frontend (Game Client) – Provides the interactive UI and gameplay mechanics for players, built with modern web/game frameworks.
2. Backend (Game Server) – Handles real-time game logic, player session management, and leaderboard updates.
3. Blockchain Integration – Connects with Soundness Layer (SL) to verify zkProofs and manage reward distribution securely.
4. Storage Layer – Stores player data, game assets, and distributed content using decentralized storage solutions.

### Stack
- **Frontend**: React (Web) / Unity (Cross-platform)
- **Backend**: Node.js (real-time) / Rust (high-performance modules)  
- **Blockchain**: Soundness Layer (SL), EVM-compatible chain for reward logic
- **Storage**: IPFS / WALRUS for assets + Database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB) for game data

### Features
1. Coconut Catching Gameplay – Simple, fast-paced reflex challenge where players catch coconuts before they fall.
2. Progressive Difficulty – Increasing speed and number of coconuts for higher challenge.
3. Rewards & Achievements – Earn points, badges, or NFTs for milestones and high scores.
4. Leaderboard System – Compete with friends and global players.
5. Soundness Layer Integration – Secure proof verification for rewards distribution.

## Timeline

### PoC (2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Basic coconut-catching gameplay loop
- [ ] Simple UI (start, play, score)
- [ ] Initial SL integration (basic proof verification)

### MVP (4-8 weeks)  
- [ ] Full features: scoring, difficulty progression, achievements
- [ ] Production-ready SL integration (NFT/Token rewards)
- [ ] Online leaderboard + basic multiplayer support
- [ ] User testing and feedback collection

## Innovation
1. **Play-to-Earn Simplicity** – Combines casual reflex gameplay with blockchain rewards (NFTs/Tokens) in a lightweight experience.
2. **Proof-based Rewards** – Uses zkProofs via Soundness Layer to ensure fair, verifiable game achievements before rewards are distributed.
3. **Accessible & Fun** – Easy to play but hard to master, making it appealing to both casual gamers and Web3 enthusiasts.
4. **Community-Driven Competition** – Leaderboards and achievements encourage social engagement and replayability.
